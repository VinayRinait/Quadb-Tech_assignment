## My Learnings

On this journey I faced many issues, but I keep motivated myself with patience.

- I learned how to write more efficient and clean code.

- Even though I also learned how to plan a project and how to execute it step by step.

- By this Project I have learned how to improve the productivity.

- I also got a glimpse of using GitHub for the version control.
